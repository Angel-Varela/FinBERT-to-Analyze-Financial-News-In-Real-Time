FinBERT Sentiment Analysis to scratch and estimate the news in 3 different WebSites:

-https://www.benzinga.com (XAU-USD)

-https://www.investing.com (XAU-USD)

-https://www.ft.com (General Market News)

----->> The purpose of this repository is to teach you how to scrapt, analyse and save news in a DataFrame for later use. This can be applied to ANY website. You just need to make sure they have a news block with title and contents.

For our experimentation we decided to scrapt news about XAU/USD or Gold Vs USD. Because gold is shiny and who doesn't like shiny?
